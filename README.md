makeTorrent
-----------


A basic python library for generating single and multi-file torrents.


Usage
-----

```python
from makeTorrent import makeTorrent

mk = makeTorrent(announce='http://example.com/announce')
```

At this point the makeTorrent class contains a dictionary, which can be printed either as a dict or as a bencoded string (torrent format).

To add files, use either the multi_file class or the single_file class

```python
mk.multi_file('/path/to/directory')

with open('my.torrent', 'wb') as tf:
    tf.write(mk.getBencoded())
```

The same method can be used with `mk.single_file` with just pointing out a single file.

Notes
-----

There are a number of items that can be added when initializing the class:

```python
mk = makeTorrent(
    announce='http://example.com/announce',
    comment='Test Torrent',
    httpseeds=['http://example.com/file.iso'],
    announcelist=[['http://announce1.example.com'],['http://announce2.example.com']]
)
```
